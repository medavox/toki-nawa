Word List
=========

Toki Nawa is mostly a modification of the words of Toki Pona and their meanings;
this means that a word list will mostly describe Toki Nawa in full.
At some point, I'll have to write some grammar notes. 
Then after that, I'll have a crack at writing a tutorial.

The following is derived from the tokipona.net word list at [http://tokipona.net/tp/ClassicWordList.aspx].

There are 28 distinct meanings for love in English, it isn't certain all of them are equal to olin. jan Sonja speaks French, Esperanto and English. So the translations of those three languages read together probably mirror mostly closely the originally intended meanings, unfortunately, AFAIK, jan Sonja never wrote a canonical French word list.

TODO: specify exact meanings of words using multiple languages

In many places you will find word origins for each word. However, these are not so useful for understanding what the word means. There is no reason to suspect that kala has the same semantic range as fish in Finnish. The word origins are merely trivia.

In about 2009, jan Kipo proposed a new view of how part of speech works in toki pona-- roughly that each word can be typically one POS, and has a certain predictable meaning when it's used outside of its ordinary POS role.
