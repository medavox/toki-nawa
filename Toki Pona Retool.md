My Proposed Improvements to Toki Pona
=====================================

The goal of this offshoot is to make an improved version of Toki Pona that is more useful 
as an auxlang.

Although speakers can use phrases to describe things that other languages have a word for,
Toki Pona today lacks words for some basic building-block concepts.
This makes it extremely difficult to be understood clearly without using long,
roundabout, misinterpretable paragraphs for familiar things.

This is not a flaw of Toki Pona, but rather a result of its design.
You are not MEANT to be able express anything complex with it.
Its goal is to simplify speech, distilling the key meaning ; it is an artlang, a language of philosophy.

However, Toki Pona's simplicity has gained it a modest international following,
where it could potentially stumble into the role of an auxlang.
But its extreme simplicity also limits its potential to communicate.
In this role, it needs words for ideas that were previously left out or ignored.

I'm retooling Toki Pona for this new purpose,
hopefully without compromising its central philosophy too much.

The goal of this offshoot is different from that of Toki Pona's -- 
or at least different from its original goal.

Its simplicity is its greatest strength; 
but I think that its inability to express fundamental parts of human existence should be fixed.

This document is a work-in-progress.

Word Definition Changes
-----------------------

No conflation between size/height/importance, simplicity/good;
    remove the common human fallacy of spatial-social equality double-meanings

High != hierarchy

### 'Suli':

* meanings as of change: 
    *mod* big, tall, long, adult, important
    *vt* enlarge, lengthen
    *n* size
* remove 'important' meaning from 'suli'. 
    - Not all big things are important, not all small things aren't
* remove 'heavy' meaning from 'suli'
    - rolling importance, size and weight into one word is a major source of confusion  

----------

* remove 'simple' meaning from 'pona'
* remove 'divine' meaning from 'sewi'
* remove 'lower part' meaning from 'noka'. replace with 'noka pini' = leg ending
* add meanings 'barter/trade' to 'esun'(v)
* remove meaning 'money' from word 'mani'?
    - Money is neither simple, good nor necessary to lead a good life
    - In fact why do we even need a word for cattle?
    - why not 'sowelo moku suli' (hopefully meaning large food land-quadruped)?
* remove 'humble', 'lowly', 'bowing down' meanings from anpa

### Opinion on Toki Pona's Connotations

Toki pona sometimes implies something is an objective truth when it's not; 
I think it needs to indicate the subjectivity of human opinion more, in its choice of the meanings combined into a single word.

I also disagree with its conflation of ideas for size with importance, and its conflation of altitude with status.
These are classic 'metaphors' in many human languages, but ones which I think damage objectivity.
Are miners of low status? are astronaut practically kings? Their altitude shouldn't matter!

It's hard to find examples that don't reinforce this trope, it turns out.
People pay much more money for the top floor of a tall building.

This isn't just Toki Pona's problem; it's a problem with human thought,
probably caused by evolutionary psychological biases: in pre-history, those at the highest point had the best chance of spotting predators. This probably gave those with a genetically-predisposed preference for being higher up, a better chance of survival.

New Words
---------
* 'pusiki' important (from welsh bwysig)
* proper comparatives:
    - 'molo' more
    - less 
    - (most? 
    - least?)

* how about a word for amount/intensity?
* spatial words for left, right
* words for frequency -- again, never, often, sometimes, rarely
    - found: tenpo mute=many times, i.e. often
* shape,
    - maybe some shape descriptive terms like flat, straight, curvy, pointy, squat, longthin
    - found:
        - 'palisa': stick, rod
* pain (n), hurt (v)
metal
    found: 
* hard/softness
    - found: kiwen= hard object, metal, rock, stone
* soft, fluffy, gentle, gradual; (v) soften
* 'opaka' heavy, difficult
* help
* free (costless/libre)
* work, housework, chores,
* together
* keep, stop, again
* stranger
* sharp (as in knife)/spicy/sour/tangy

Reinstated Words
----------------

* 'kapesi' brown/grey: colour of slate, mud, metal
* 'leko' square, cube, block, square-shaped, cube-shaped
* 'majuna' old, age
* 'pasila' easy, simple, light (opposite of heavy)

New Grammar-Words
-------------

* question marker word - turns a statement into a question of whether the statement is so.
   - a direct translation of the word would be 'is it that', or 'is the following true'
* word meaning multiplier of next number word, so you can say 'four WORD twenty', 'five and twenty'
* passivity marker? a word which means the verb is being done TO the object (eg 'po')
    so 'pana' means give, 'po pana' means is given (receive)
    'utala' means attack, 'po utala' means is attacked
* conversion/transformation/application transitive verb? to make something <adjective>?

Word Name/Spelling Changes
--------------------------
* spread out words across the phonological space more evenly; reduce similar-sounding wordgroups:
    - ijo/ilo
    - poki/poka
    - ko/kon
    - kala/kalama/kama
    - nasa/nasin
    - pan/pana
    - selo/seli/sewi/suli/suwi
* replace sina -> si
    - the word for 'you' is very common; it would be better if it was as short as possible.
* replace (namako, sin) -> nawa
    - 'sin' is too easily confused with 'sina' (now 'si'), and namako is now superfluous.
* replace sitelen -> tesen
    - from french 'dessin', but with a harmonised second vowel
    - 'sitelen' is a false friend in English -- it means drawing/writing, not (web)site
    - tesen is also shorter
* shorten 'kepeken' -> 'usu' (from latin 'usus', and English 'use', with harmonised vowels)
    - 'kepeken' doesn't *sound* like a toki pona word to me. 
    (maybe it has phonotactic rules that have emerged as a result of its vocabulary?)
    - It's also quite long.

### Phonic Space

I will definitely not add to the phonology;
I don't know enough about linguistic typology to choose new sounds
(or new phonotactic rules) that are as easy for all humans to pronounce.

Instead, I'm merely using the raw material given to me 
by Toki Pona's phonology and phonotactics
to construct new words.

But in order to use that raw material well, I need to know exactly what it consists of.
So let's work out the possible syllables in Toki Pona.

9 consonants (j k l m n p s t w)
5 vowels (a e i o u)

5 lone-vowel syllables: a e i o u

41 CV syllable words, minus 4 disallowed sounds (ji, ti, wo, and wu)

41 more CVn syllables

dual-syllable words:

"Toki Pona's syllables all follow a pattern: consonant + vowel + optional n. 
If a syllable is at the beginning of a word, the consonant is optional
(For example, ali and unpa don't begin with consonants).
The optional n is forbidden if the next syllable begins with m or n."

These rules produce over 6000 potential dual-syllable words;
so why does Toki Pona (a language with ~120 words) even HAVE 3-syllable words?

### New Phonotactic Provisional Rules

* should all vowels in a word harmonise?
* should all consonant clusters be removed? (nanpa, unpa, tenpo, monsi, linja)
* remove one of the nasal sounds?
    - they can be hard to distinguish from each other

Orthography
----------

* Map all words to Emojis
* Map all words to Pokemon!

Discarded Ideas
---------------

* Colour, -coloured (so you can describe a colour using comparisons to other things)
    - there is already the word 'kule' which can be used as above
* 'mete' get/take/receive -- instead use passivity marker with give
    - although this prevents us from using 'mete ike' as 'stealing'
* stone/ball/egg/round
    - found: 'sike' circle, wheel, sphere, ball, cycle, round, cyclical
* co-operate/collaborate/work together (mitarbeiten)
    - just use 'work together', if those words are added
