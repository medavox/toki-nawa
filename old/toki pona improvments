My Proposed Improvements to Toki Pona
=====================================

The goal of this offshoot is to make an improved version of Toki Pona that is more useful 
as an auxlang.

Although speakers must still use phrases to describe things that other language use words for,
normal Toki Pona lacks words for some basic building-block concepts,
that make it nearly impossible to communicate clearly without using long,
roundabout, misinterpretable paragraphs.

This is not a flaw of Toki Pona, but rather a result of its design;
you are not MEANT to be able express anything complex with it.
Its goal is to simplify speech; it is an artlang, a language of philosophy.

However, its extreme simplicity has made it a good candidate as an auxlang.
In this role, it will need words for ideas that previously could be omitted.

I'm retooling Toki Pona for this new purpose, 
hopefully without compromising its central philosophy too much

Word Definition Changes
-----------------------

no conflation between size/height/importance, simplicity/good;
    remove common-human-fallacy spatial-social metaphor double-meanings
remove 'important' meaning from 'suli'. 
    Not all big things are important, not all small things aren't
remove 'heavy' from 'suli'
    rolling importance, size and weight into one word is a major source of confusion
remove 'simple' meaning from 'pona'
remove 'divine' meaning from 'sewi'
remove 'lower part' meaning from 'noka'. replace with 'noka pini' = leg ending
add meanings 'barter/trade' to 'esun'(v)
?remove meaning 'money' from word 'mani'.
    Money is neither simple, good nor necessary to lead a good life
    In fact why do we even need a word for cattle? 
        why not 'sowelo moku suli' (hopefully meaning large food land-quadruped)?
remove 'humble', 'lowly', 'bowing down' meanings from anpa

New Words
---------
'pusiki' important (from welsh bwysig)

proper comparatives: 
    more, ?molo
    less 
    (most? 
    least?)
how about a word for amount/intensity?
spatial words for left, right

words for frequency -- again, never, often, sometimes, rarely
    found: tenpo mute=many times, i.e. often
?passivity marker: a word which means the verb is being done TO the object (eg 'po')
    so 'pana' means give, 'po pana' means is given (receive)
    'utala' means attack, 'po utala' means is attacked
shape, 
    maybe some shape descriptive terms like flat, straight, curvy, pointy, squat, longthin
    found:
pain, hurt
metal
hard/softness
    found: kiwen= hard object, metal, rock, stone
'opaka' heavy, difficult
help
work
co-operate/collaborate/work together (mitarbeiten)
keep, stop, again
stranger
stone/ball/egg/round
    found: sike=     circle, wheel, sphere, ball, cycle, round, cyclical
sharp (as in knife)/spicy/sour/tangy

Reinstated Words
----------------

'kapesi' brown/grey; colour of slate, mud, metal
'leko' square, cube, block, square-shaped, cube-shaped
'majuna' old, age
'pasila' easy, simple, light (opposite of heavy)


New Grammar-Words
-------------

question marker word - turns a statement into a question of whether the statement is so
word meaning multiplier of next number word, so you can say 'four WORD twenty', 'five and twenty'

Word Name/Spelling Changes
--------------------------
spread out words across the phonological space more evenly; reduce similar-sounding wordgroups:
    ijo/ilo
    poki/poka
    ko/kon
    kala/kalama/kama
    nasa/nasin
    pan/pana
    selo/seli/sewi/suli/suwi
replace sina -> si
replace namako, sin -> nawa
replace false friend sitelen (means drawing/writing, not website) -> tesen 
    (from french 'dessin', but with a harmonised second vowel)
shorten kepeken

### Phonic Space

I am not going to change the phonology;
I don't know enough about linguistic typology to choose new sounds (or new phonotactic rules)
that are as easy for all humans to pronounce.

Instead, I merely use the raw material given to me by Toki Pona's phonology and phonotactics,
to construct new words.

But in order to use that raw material, I need to know exactly what I have.
So let's work out the possible sounds in Toki Pona.

9 consonants (j k l m n p s t w)
5 vowels (a e i o u)

5 lone-vowel syllables: a e i o u

41 CV syllable words, minus 4 disallowed sounds (ji, ti, wo, and wu)

41 more CVn syllables

dual-syllable words:

"Toki Pona's syllables all follow a pattern: consonant + vowel + optional n. 
If a syllable is at the beginning of a word, the consonant is optional
(For example, ali and unpa don't begin with consonants).
The optional n is forbidden if the next syllable begins with m or n."

new rules: should all vowels in a word harmonise?
should we remove all consonant clusters? (nanpa, unpa, tenpo, monsi, linja)

Discarded Ideas
---------------

colour, -coloured (so you can describe a colour using comparisons to other things)
    there is already the word 'kule' which can be used as above
new word for get/take/receive 'mete' -- instead use passivity marker with give
    although this prevents us from using 'mete ike' as 'stealing'
