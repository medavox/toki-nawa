Proposed Improvements to Toki Pona
==================================

Goals

1. be easy to learn
2. be easy to pronounce
3. be more expressive than toki pona

4. be easy to understand

The goal of this offshoot is to make an improved version of Toki Pona that is more useful 
as an auxlang.

Although speakers can use phrases to describe things that other languages have a word for,
Toki Pona today lacks words for some basic building-block concepts.
This makes it extremely difficult to be understood clearly without using long,
roundabout, misinterpretable paragraphs for familiar things.

This is not a flaw of Toki Pona, but rather a result of its design.
You are not MEANT to be able express anything complex with it.
Its goal is to simplify speech, distilling the key meaning ; it is an artlang, a language of philosophy.

However, Toki Pona's simplicity has gained it a modest international following,
where it could potentially stumble into the role of an auxlang.
But its extreme simplicity also limits its potential to communicate.
In this role, it needs words for ideas that were previously left out or ignored.

I'm retooling Toki Pona for this new purpose,
hopefully without compromising its central philosophy too much.

The goal of this offshoot is different from that of Toki Pona's -- 
or at least different from its original goal.

Its simplicity is its greatest strength; 
but I think that its inability to express fundamental parts of human existence should be changed.

This document is a work-in-progress.

Word Definition Changes
=====

No conflation between size/height/importance, simplicity/good;
    remove the common human fallacy of spatial-social equality double-meanings

High != hierarchy

----------

* remove 'divine' meaning from 'sewi'
* remove 'crazy' meaning from 'nasa'
* remove 'lower part' meaning from 'noka'. replace with 'noka pini' = leg ending
* add meanings 'barter/trade' to 'esun'(v)
* remove meaning 'money' from word 'mani'?
    - Money is neither simple, good nor necessary to lead a good life
    - In fact why do we even need a word for cattle?
    - why not 'sowelo moku suli' (hopefully meaning large food land-quadruped)?
* remove 'humble', 'lowly', 'bowing down' meanings from anpa
* add 'start, beginning' meanings to 'open'

New Words
=========

* proper comparatives:
    - 'molo' more
    - less 
    - (most? 
    - least?)

* how about a word for amount/intensity?
* spatial words for left, right
* words for frequency -- again, never, often, sometimes, rarely
    - found: tenpo mute=many times, i.e. often
* shape,
    - maybe some shape descriptive terms like flat, straight, curvy, pointy, squat, longthin
    - found:
        - 'palisa': stick, rod
* pain (n), hurt (v)
metal
    found: 
* hard/softness
    - found: kiwen= hard object, metal, rock, stone
* soft, fluffy, gentle, gradual; (v) soften
* help
* free (costless/libre)
* work, housework, chores,
* together
* keep, stop, again
* stranger
* sharp (as in knife)/spicy/sour/tangy
* sorry
* thank you
* fast
* danger
* smell
    - found: kon
* breath, breathing
* OK
* artificial, man-made
* uncooked
    - used to part of word for 'cold',
    but what about cooked food that's gone cold??


Reinstated Words
================

* 'majuna' old, age

New Grammar-Words
=================

* question marker word 'ki' - turns a statement into a question of whether the statement is so.
   - a direct translation of the word would be 'is it that', or 'is the following true'
* word meaning multiplier of next number word, so you can say 'four WORD twenty', 'five twenties'
* passivity marker? a word which means the verb is being done TO the object (eg 'po')
    so 'pana' means give, 'po pana' means is given (receive)
    'utala' means attack, 'po utala' means is attacked
* conversion/transformation/application transitive verb? to make something <adjective> eg large + <word> = enlargen?
* marker word for a person or thing that is the one doing the action, eg emitter

Word Name/Spelling Changes
==========================

Spread out words across the phonological space more evenly; reduce similar-sounding wordgroups:


- poki/poka
- ko/kon
- kala/kalama/kama
- nasa/nasin
- pan/pana
- selo/seli/sewi/suli/suwi

There are a finite number of consonant-vowel syllables.

Two words that are made of the same syllables *in the same order* are identical.

Two syllables are said to be 'half-identical' if they share either a consonant or a vowel.

Two words are considered to be 'too similar' if they only differ by a half-similar syllable.

To do: Include ending -n sounds in this model

Phonology
=========

I will definitely not add sounds (phonemes) to the phonology;
I don't know enough about linguistic typology to choose new sounds
(or new phonotactic rules) that are as easy for all humans to pronounce.

Instead, I'm merely using the raw material given to me 
by Toki Pona's phonology and phonotactics
to construct new words.

But in order to use that raw material well, I need to know exactly what it consists of.
So let's work out the possible syllables in Toki Pona.

9 consonants (p t k m n s j l w)
5 vowels (a e i o u)

5 lone-vowel syllables: a e i o u

41 CV syllable words, minus 4 disallowed sounds (ji, ti, wo, and wu)

41 more CVn syllables

dual-syllable words:

"Toki Pona's syllables all follow a pattern: consonant + vowel + optional n. 
If a syllable is at the beginning of a word, the consonant is optional
(For example, ali and unpa don't begin with consonants).
The optional n is forbidden if the next syllable begins with m or n."

These rules produce over 6000 potential dual-syllable words;
so why does Toki Pona (a language with ~120 words) even HAVE 3-syllable words?

The Argument for removing sounds
-------------

We don't even need as many different sounds as toki pona already has,
in order to express the tiny number of words it has.

Conlang Critic suggests that toki pona could use 3 vowels
to be made even easier for speakers of 3-vowel languages (eg for speakers of Arabic).

Should we remove one of the nasal sounds?
they CAN be hard to distinguish from each other when speaking

* Merge i and e vowels

These sounds have always been hard to keep separate in my head,
possibly because of the english dialect I was raised in.

I can tell them apart, but I can't always remember which one goes where.

I can't imagine I'm the only one that struggles to disinguish these sounds.

As I said earlier, toki pona has an overabundance of sounds;
it doesn't need all the sounds it does have.

So why not simplify?

* There is a similar argument for l and w.

/l/, and its merged phoneme  /r/, vary a lot in their pronunciation.
These variations may prove to be mutually unintelligible.
If we can afford to leave out a sound we can't all agree on, we should.

If Toki Nawa sounds a bit like baby speak, that probably means I've achieved my aim:
It should sound so simplistic as to be familiar to everyone.

So, Toki Nawa's phonemes are:-

p t k m n s w j

a i o u

I'm still not sure about differentiating m and n, as these are easily mistaken for one another.

This new sound-set means that some close-sounding words are currently homophones; I'll need to fix that.

I've removed syllable-final n sounds. N can now only be used as a consonant, or at the end of the whole word -- 
NOT at the end of a syllable, next to another consonant.


### New Phonotactic Provisional Rules

* should all vowels in a word harmonise?
* should all consonant clusters be removed? (nanpa, unpa, tenpo, monsi, linja)
* require all words start with a consonant, end with a vowel?
    - reduces sandhi, allows words to flow better?


Orthography
-----------

* Map all words to Emojis
* Map all words to Pokemon!

Ideas Implemented in Dictionary Table
-------------------------------------

### 'Suli':

* meanings as of change: 
    *mod* big, tall, long, adult, important
    *vt* enlarge, lengthen
    *n* size
* remove 'important' meaning from 'suli'. 
    - Not all big things are important, not all small things aren't
* remove 'heavy' meaning from 'suli'
    - rolling importance, size and weight into one word is a major source of confusion  


* remove 'simple' meaning from 'pona',
    - 'evil', 'complex' meanings from 'ike'

-------

* 'opaka' heavy, difficult
* 'pusiki' important (from welsh bwysig)
* 'kapesi' brown/grey: colour of slate, mud, metal
* 'leko' square, cube, block, square-shaped, cube-shaped
* 'pasila' easy, simple, light (opposite of heavy)

-----

* ilo -> tuka
    - reduce confusion with ijo, which is s
    - loosely inspired by German 'Werkzeug'
* replace sina -> si
    - the word for 'you' is very common; it would be better if it was as short as possible.
* replace (namako, sin) -> nawa
    - 'sin' is too easily confused with 'sina' (now 'si'), and namako is now superfluous.
* replace sitelen -> tesen
    - from french 'dessin', but with a harmonised second vowel
    - 'sitelen' is a false friend in English -- it means drawing/writing, not (web)site
    - tesen is also shorter
* shorten 'kepeken' -> 'usu' (from latin 'usus', and English 'use', with harmonised vowels)
    - 'kepeken' doesn't *sound* like a toki pona word to me. 
    (maybe it has phonotactic rules that have emerged as a result of its vocabulary?)
    - It's also quite long.
* palisa -> kalisa
    - to avoid similarity with pasila


Discarded Ideas
---------------

* Colour, -coloured (so you can describe a colour using comparisons to other things)
    - there is already the word 'kule' which can be used as above
* 'mete' get/take/receive -- instead use passivity marker with give
    - although this prevents us from using 'mete ike' as 'stealing'
* stone/ball/egg/round
    - found: 'sike' circle, wheel, sphere, ball, cycle, round, cyclical
* co-operate/collaborate/work together (mitarbeiten)
    - just use 'work together', if those words are added
