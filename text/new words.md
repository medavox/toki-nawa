Unnamed Candidate Words
=======================

The strategy here is to freely add potential words for concepts I know Tuki Nuwa doesn't have word for,
then later delete the word if I can create a decent equivalent phrase which means the same thing.

THe hardest part of creating a new word is finding a good-sounding lexeme for it,
so that can be deferred until I know the word is definitely being added.
