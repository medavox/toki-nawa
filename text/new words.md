Unnamed Candidate Words
=======================

The strategy here is to freely add potential words for concepts I know Tuki Nuwa doesn't have word for,
then later delete the word if I can create a decent equivalent phrase which means the same thing.

THe hardest part of creating a new word is finding a good-sounding lexeme for it,
so that can be deferred until I know the word is definitely being added.

In the meantime, words without a lexeme will be referred to by a short version of their definition, in <angle brackets>.

### Key

symbol | meaning
-------|--------
++     | will definitely be included once I've decided on a lexeme.
+      | will probably be included, barring any new evidence or change of mind
?      | might be included; I'm on the fence/ not sure; undecided (possibly yet)
-      | might not be included; I've probably found a way to express the meaning of this word with a verbose phrase
--     | REALLY probably not going to add this.
adj    | adjective: describing word
sth    | something
sb     | someone/somebody

Grammar Words
-------------

Status:Notes | Attaches to (POS) | results in (POS) | Meaning
-------------|-------------------|------------------|--------
? probably this is a copula | adj | verb | to have the property of the following adj phrase; to be <adj phrase>
+:iku | adj | verb | to gain the property of the following adj phrase (by oneself); to become <adj phrase>, to get <adj phrase>; consider using kama (come to)
+:nisa | verb, adjective | noun | next adj- or verb-phrase is a noun; "-ness"`<adj phrase>`-ness; state of being `<adj phrase>`; the act of doing `<verb phrase>`; `<verb phrase>`-ation. Goes before the affected phrase
+ liki  | verb, noun | adjective | previous word is an adjective/adverb; -y, -ly; in the manner of; like; LIKE~AS~WAY, similar to, in a similar manner to

nisa might be unecessary, as the position of the phrase in the sentence indicates whether a word is a noun
it's not unecessary, because nouns may be used as part of a phrase, where their POS is ambiguous

to Xify = jupa
to be Xified jupa X puha
to become X = iku
