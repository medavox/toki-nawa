* To emphasise an adjective, repeat that adjective. Or use whatever passes for 'very' these days


Part-of-Speech Markers
=============

Words have an inherent or default part-of-speech role, indicated by their vowel ending (or no inherent role if they end in n).

A word's role in a sentence can often be inferred from context, word-order, li and i markers etc.

But explicit grammar words can be used to indicate part-of-speech when deemed necessary, for instance in a complex noun phrase.



Forming Questions
==========

A statement can be turned into a question by preceding it with *ki*. This word roughly translates as *is it the case that*.

*Ki si wilu moku?* Do you want to eat?/Are you hungry?

*Ki mi muta jan? ju ki mi muta jan pi tawa musi?* Are we human? or are we dancers?

*jan miwi puna luku u, ki si wilu isun e win kapi?* do you want to buy a hat, pretty lady?

*ki jan lili li lapi?* (are the children/is the child) asleep?
