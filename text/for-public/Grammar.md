* To emphasise an adjective, repeat that adjective. Or use whatever passes for 'very' these days


Part-of-Speech Markers
=============

Words have an inherent or default part-of-speech role, indicated by their vowel ending (or no inherent role if they end in n).

A word's role in a sentence can often be inferred from context, word-order, li and i markers etc.

But explicit grammar words can be used to indicate part-of-speech when deemed necessary, for instance in a complex noun phrase.



Forming Questions
==========

A statement can be turned into a question by preceding it with *ki*. This word roughly translates as *is it the case that*.

*Ki si wilu moku?* Do you want to eat?/Are you hungry?

*Ki mi muta jan? ju ki mi muta jan pi tawa musi?* Are we human? or are we dancers?

*jan miwi puna luku u, ki si wilu isun e win kapi?* do you want to buy a hat, pretty lady?

*ki jan nuwa li lapi?* (are the children/is the child) asleep?

Topic Marker
===========

*Wa* can be used in a number of ways. 

It can be used for describing __when__ something happened:

*Ipuki pini wa, mi nami nata e kiwi suwi*

In the past, I didn't eat fruit (or I didn't eat the fruit)

It can also be used to separate a complex subject- or object-phrase from the rest of the sentence

Past, Present and Future
======

When a verb takes place in the present, we use li to seperate the noun doing the verb, from the verb itself.

If it happens in the future or the past, we use different words blah1 and blah2:



Reflexive Pronouns
======

If someone does something to oneself, we use *sama*:

*lu li nimi lu sama na Alex*

she calls herself Alex
