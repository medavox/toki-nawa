This document describes changes having to do with my own variant of toki pona's philosophy
of simplicity and 'good'.

The goal of creating a Language of Good may not necessarily align with the goal of
creating an ideal auxiliary language.

For that, the language should be easy to learn, and be as easy to understand as possible.
AKA easy to learn, easy to use.

Complexity is not inherently bad.

Complexity is a tool; and like any tool, it can be used for good or bad; or in a good or bad way.
People who do bad don't always mean to.

One word for 'animal' and 'person'

Opinion on Toki Pona's Connotations
------------

Toki Pona conflates ideas of size with importance, and altitude with status.
These are classic 'metaphors' in many human languages, but ones which I think damage objectivity.
Are submarine crew of low status? are astronauts practically kings? Their altitude shouldn't matter!

It's hard to find examples that don't reinforce this trope, it turns out.
People pay much more money for the top floor of a tall building.

This isn't just Toki Pona's problem; it may be a problem with human thought,
probably caused by evolutionary psychological biases: 
in pre-history, those at the highest point had the best chance of spotting predators.

This probably gave those with a genetically-predisposed preference for being higher up
a higher chance of surviving long enough to mate.

The base list of words should use the research on 
[Semantic Primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_primes) and a 
[Natural Semantic Metalanguage](https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/schools-departments/natural-semantic-metalanguage). 
Multiple primes can still be rolled into one lexeme,
but I think all ~64 semantic primes should be expressible in toki nawa.

this language will still lean heavily on phrases as compound words.

-----

All words will use two or fewer syllables.

* make the sounds for words align with the research on human-universal sound choices for primitive meanings

No words should be formed as a portmanteau from two (or more) existing words --
there is already a phrase for that, and if every concept received this treatment,
the language's number of words would grow exponentially.

------

Phrases should not be fossilised into static usages: new words in all but name.
The appropriate phrase to describe something is made from the thing's features
that are relevant to the current context.

The same phrases may pop up again and again, but that does not make them words.
That just increases the burden on new learners, 
who must also memorise all these 'compound words', which aren't even documented properly.
It also means that ~120 words is a lie.

Baaad toki pona. 

Instead, commonly used phrases for things should be intuitive enough to occur naturally to new speakers.
(That is, speakers who have just finished learning the language, and are using for the first time.)

If they don't, they are just arbitrary symbols for things (AKA words) which learners would have to memorise.
They must be replaced by better phrases.

------

Use a 'medieval' numbering system -- similar to the french vigisemal ('four twenties and ten')
will be used. This might involve one or two new words to keep the number-parts straight,
properly separated from each other.

Toki Nawa should still have a version of Toki Pona's aversion to 'big' numbers -- 
you won't be able to describe numbers with more than 2 or 3 significant figures.

I still need to figure out how to make that limitation an inherent property.

un tu pi wuka = one two of five = (1 + 2) * 5 = 15

-------

word order must be followed more strictly than in canonical toki pona -- 
see [Reading Toki Pona is Hard](http://www.suburbandestiny.com/?p=845)

------

consider marking what part of speech a word represents by its ending, similarish to esperanto
(but ONLY mark the POS, no conjugation or anything else!)

so 'utali' could be a battle, and 'utala' is to battle

use -n ending too if we REALLY need more, but that could be overly complex

------

consider modifying or removing words for 'male' and 'female' to reflect non-binary reality. After all: GENDER IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT. Why have two whole words for easily splitting people into two groups based on an unimportant property?

------

no separate words for artifical/natural versions of things; eg room = cave
